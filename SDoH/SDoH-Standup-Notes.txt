1. Kyle will put HRQ data stuff in s3, we need to pull from it.
2. Join HRQ and demographics data
3. postal code is same as zip code (5 digits code, +4 digits after it), most part it is just zip
4. Mike is pulling postal code extensions in demographic files
5. We need to perform clustering 
6. After clustering, use clusters as target label and run an algorithm either rf and xgb and  pull shap values to understand feature importance
7. Take 2020 data, if data is not available for 2020 then go for 2019.
8. Experiment with both option, clustering first or joining first.
9. Trying to assign risk scores based on clusters
10. We can start with 5 clusters and then edit accordingly
11. Need to do scalling before clustering
12. HRQ is Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality
13. SDoH- Social Determinants of Health Database
14. Heath outcomes and health care quality we need to focus at first and then can include insurance later
15. Zip code 2020 is not available, we can work with 2019 zip code but it have handful of variables
16. Need to check if county data is available, but as per Mike it is not and a way for that is we can join zip code data with county as it is one to one join and later can join demo data with it.
